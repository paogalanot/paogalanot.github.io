The “bellicist” paradigm has attracted theoretical criticism both within and beyond its original domain of applicability. While several recent studies have analyzed the internal aspects of Tilly's theory, there have been very few systematic attempts to assess its logic with regard to the territorial expansion of states. In this paper, we test this key aspect of bellicist theory directly by aligning historical data on European state borders with conflict data, focusing on the period from 1490 through 1790. Proceeding at the systemic, state, and dyadic levels, our analysis confirms that warfare did in fact play a crucial role in the territorial expansion of European states before (and beyond) the French Revolution. </details> </li> </ol> <h2 id="work-in-progress">Work in Progress</h2> <ol> <li> <strong>Engines of Progress: Nation-building and Railroad Construction in Latin America</strong> <details> <summary>Abstract</summary> <br> Where do states extend their territorial reach? In Latin America, many states have failed at establishing full control over their territories. This paper examines the origins of this uneven distribution of territorial reach by looking at one of the main state-building projects in the region: railway construction in the 19th and early 20th centuries. While the literature increasingly focuses on sub-national differences in state capacity and their political determinants, railways have only been examined at the national-level and as economic projects. Thus, we know very little about how nation-building and integrative concerns influenced the design of state reach, particularly railway construction. In this paper, I test the conventional wisdom that railroads were built to facilitate trade but propose the argument that they were also built to establish access to the core political community and "threatening" ethnic groups. These arguments are tested by constructing a novel spatial dataset of railway networks in the period of expansion (1880-1930), and linking these to spatial measures of core group presence, colonial ethnic resistance and native territorial control. The results support the argument that railways were provided in regions with core populations, while also connecting regions with pre-existing ethnic threats to the center. These findings hold after controlling for relevant trade determinants, indicating that railways often served dual aims of trade and integration. </details> </li> <li> <strong>Conflict and nation: The colonial origins of ethnic exclusion and discrimination in Latin America</strong> (with Luis L. Schenoni, Raul L. Madrid and Guillermo Kreiman) <details> <summary>Abstract</summary> <br> Why do some ethnic groups gain rights through mobilization against the state, while others become targeted for doing so? We argue that whether mobilization leads to inclusion or further exclusion of peripheral ethnic groups depends on the long-term trajectory of conflict. When peripheral groups have a history of conflict with the state, they often develop an oppositional identity that core groups can frame as a threat, thereby justifying intensified targeting and exclusion. We test this argument in the context of nineteenth-century South America, where core Creole elites established new nations on a fluid sociopolitical landscape, shaping ethnic boundaries that were still malleable while facing multiple and frequent conflicts with these groups. Our findings suggest that patterns of colonial-era conflict between white and non-white groups determined whether later inter-ethnic conflicts during state and nation-building led to ethnic exclusion and targeting. </details> </li> <li> <strong>The Return of Nationalist Geopolitics: Liberal Backsliding and Conflict</strong> (with Lars-Erik Cederman, Luc Girardin, Andreas Juon, and Julian Wucherpfennig) <details> <summary>Abstract</summary> <br> The post-Cold War decline of conflict has turned into an increase both within and between states. Many observers interpret this development as the return of geopolitics and great power competition. Shifting the focus to nationalist geopolitics, we link this violent resurgence to the exclusion of ethnic groups and their transborder kin. Using newly collected data on ethnic power relations, we explore trends in ethnic exclusion and conflict, analyze difference-in-difference models to establish a connection between these trends, and build counterfactual scenarios to assess the violent impact of ethnic nationalism since the early 2010s. Overall, our analysis confirms that liberal backsliding has contributed to increased conflict around the world, a trend shift that cannot be reduced to intensified great power competition. </details> </li> <li> <strong>Does Internal Conflict Promote State-building? Evidence from Nineteenth-century Argentina</strong> (with Jorge Mangonnet, Christopher Carter, and Federico Lombisano) <details> <summary>Abstract</summary> <br> What is the impact of internal conflict on state building? The conventional wisdom claims that, unlike inter-state conflict, internal conflict can overwhelm and weaken the state, such as in Latin America. Yet, shifting attention to the sub-national level, recent research has shown that internal conflict can serve as an incentive to state-building, as states aim to regain control and legitimacy in areas previously affected by rebellion. This paper examines this process in 19th century Argentina, where the state gradually conquered the frontier to counter-act continuous indigenous resistance. Using novel fine-grained historical and spatial data on indigenous raids and sub-national state capacity, we examine how state-building differed across municipalities with lower and higher rates of ethnic conflict. In particular, we test the expectation that states increased their territorial presence in localities that had experienced more conflict, while under-investing in public service provision.  Additionally, we exploit a moving frontier line to compare recently “conquered” municipalities with those still retaining autonomy from the state. The findings are relevant to understand the complexity of the conflict-state capacity nexus, and shed light on the ways states built capacity in frontier regions. </details> </li> <li> <strong>Rethinking Rebellion: A Conceptual Introduction to the Latin American Revolts Dataset</strong> (with Raul Madrid, Luis L. Schenoni, and Guillermo Kreiman) <details> <summary>Abstract</summary> <br> The literature on organized political violence has developed in silos that separately examine highly correlated and sometimes overlapping phenomena, such as coups and civil wars. In this article we argue that looking at the umbrella concept of revolt can enhance conceptual validity, and satisfy an increasing demand for cross-national datasets on rebellions broadly defined, breathing new life into old debates. As our main empirical contribution, we introduce a new, comprehensive dataset of revolts that have taken place in Latin America from 1830 to 2023. With hundreds recorded revolts, the Latin American Revolts Dataset (LARD) provides a tenfold expansion of the observations in previous cross-national datasets, geolocates these events, and codes them along twenty theoretically relevant characteristics. By identifying subtypes of rebellion, LARD also systematizes and integrates previous categories, allowing for their independent examination, and providing a framework for the reorganization of the empirical agendas on political violence in other regions. </details> </li> </ol> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2025 Paola Galano Toro.
