I am a Visiting professor/Postdoc in Political Science at the University Carlos III in Madrid, Spain. Previously, I was a postdoctorall fellow at the International Conflict Research at ETH Zurich, Switzerland, where I also completed my dissertation. During my PhD I was also a visting student at University College London. 

My research focuses on the link between state capacity, ethnic favoritism, and conflict, with a regional focus on Latin America. In particular, my dissertation examined the impact of nation-building concerns on state-building in Latin America, looking at how the status assigned to ethnic groups within a countryâ€™s territory affected the development of sub-national state capacity. My work typically makes use of novel spatial and historical data sources. While most of my research focuses on Latin America, I have also done work on European state formation and on global trends in ethnic conflict. 

Here you can find more information about my research, and you can also access my contact information.
