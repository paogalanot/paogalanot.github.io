I am a Visiting professor/Postdoc in Political Science at the University Carlos III in Madrid, Spain. Previously, I was a postdoctorall fellow at the International Conflict Research at ETH Zurich, Switzerland, where I also completed my dissertation in 2024. During my PhD I was also a visting student at University College London in the Spring Term of 2022. 

My research focuses on the link between state capacity, ethnic favoritism, and conflict, with a regional focus on Latin America. In particular, my dissertation examined the impact of nation-building concerns on state-building in Latin America, looking at how the status assigned to ethnic groups within a countryâ€™s territory affected the development of sub-national state capacity. My work typically makes use of novel spatial and historical data sources. While most of my research focuses on Latin America, I have also done work on European state formation and on global trends in ethnic conflict.
